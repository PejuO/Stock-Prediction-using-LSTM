 The purpose of this project is to design a stock prediction linear model to predict the closing price of Amazon. This project is done in 
two parts.

1.	First, the stock price is predicted using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and 
2. 	A stock analysis dashboard using Plotly dash.
